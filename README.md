As the co-author of Babylon.js, a WebGL gaming engine, I was always felt a little uneasy listening to folks discuss accessibility best practices at web conferences. The content created with Babylon.js is indeed completely inaccessible to blind people. Making the web accessible to everyone is very important. I’m more convinced than ever about that as I’m personally touched via my own son. And so I wanted to contribute to the accessibility of the web in some way.

That’s why I decided to work on creating a game that uses WebGL and is fully accessible, to prove that visual games aren’t inherently inaccessible. I chose to keep it simple, so I created a breakout clone.

You can test it in a Web Audio compatible browser: http://david.blob.core.windows.net/accessibility/accessiblebreakout/index.html or download the source code here.

Now, let me share with you the background story of this game and all the experiments involved... More on my blog: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davrous/archive/2015/08/27/creating-an-accessible-breakout-game-using-web-audio-amp-svg.aspx
