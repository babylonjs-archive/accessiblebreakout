Accessible Breakout Experiment

Making the web accessible to everybody is very important. I’m more convinced than ever about the importance of accessibility as I’m personally touched via my own son. Still, as the co-author of Babylon.js, a WebGL gaming engine, I was feeling stupid while listening to accessibility best practices in web conferences.

I’ve then decided to work on that by creating a game. An accessible breakout game.

You can test it in a Web Audio compatible browser: http://david.blob.core.windows.net/accessibility/accessiblebreakout/index.html or download the source code here.
